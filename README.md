# Who am I?
Hey there! I am Chandrahas Gabbita, a recent graduate from Stony Brook University. I am a double major in Physics and Mathematics and am interested in the field of Data Analysis and Data Science. Over the last year, I have been learning data science through a combination of coursework, certifications, and projects. It has been a fascinating journey and if you'd like to learn more about it, take a look at my resume below and keep scrolling!

## What can I do?
I can help draw insights and predictions from data starting with exploratory data analysis to model validation, testing, and visualization. My coursework includes advanced Physics and Math, Statistics, Data Analysis (Regression Modelling), and Machine Learning for Quantitative Finance. I have completed the Google Advanced Data Analytics certification during which I familiarized myself with many more machine learning methods especailly suited for tabular data.

# My Projects 

## Google Advanced Data Analytics Capstone Project
As a part of the Google Advanced Data Analytics certification, I have completed a data analysis profject from beginning to end. The project deals with a hypothetical Salifort Motors, and aims to predict employee retention in the company. The data set contains data collected from employees on a variety of factors such as their satisfaction level, salary, and the number of years they have worked for the company etc. In addition, the data also includes whether the employee stayed in the company or left. This data set wsa borrowed from Kggle and can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/leviiiest/salifort-motor-hr-dataset?select=HR_capstone_dataset.csv). The project includes the following stages:

**Exploratory Data Analysis**
- The structure of the data was examined and contained the following format:

- The missing values in the dataset were removed and the appropriate statistics were calculated
- Different varaibles in the dataset were checked for linear dependence
